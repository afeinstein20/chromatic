# `chromatic`

Can we make a friendly python tool to standardize working with and visualizing spectroscopic light curves? Something like lightkurveÃ—ðŸŒˆ?

This package defines a spectroscopic light curve object (a `Rainbow`) with easy access to wavelength, time, flux, and uncertainty attributes. It should also allow reading and writing these datasets from/to a variety of formats and provide useful visualizations or tools.
